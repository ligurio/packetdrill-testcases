Precondition:
IUT does support PR-SCTP. 
Let the IUT send a INIT-Chunk with the Forward-TSN-Supported parameter set. 
Arrange the data at the tester that an INIT-ACK-Chunk is sent, where the Forward-TSN-Supported parameter
is listed at the Unrecognized Parameters.

Purpose:
Ensure the IUT to either:
<ol>
	<li>end the initiation process. (in cases where the initiation process already ended, it may need to send an ABORT)</li>
	<li>continue the initiation process and marks the association such that PR-SCTP is NOT supported. 
	     In this case the endpoint receiving the operational error should note that the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk is NOT supported.
		 Also ensure that the IUT does not trasmit a FORWARD-TSN-Chunk at any time during the association.
	</li>
</ol>

Precondition:
IUT does support PR-SCTP. 
Association is not established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that an INIT-Chunk with a forward-tsn-supported parameter is sent to the IUT. 
Dont send an COOKIE-ECHO-Chunk after receival of the INIT-ACK-Chunk from the IUT. 
Instead retransmit the INIT-Chunk - but this time without the forward tsn parameter set.
After that complete the handshake for this association. 

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT has disabled PR-SCTP for this association.

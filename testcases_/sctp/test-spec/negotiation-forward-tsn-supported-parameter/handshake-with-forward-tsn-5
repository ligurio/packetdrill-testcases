Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP.
Association is established between tester and IUT, where in the INIT-ACK-Chunk sent by the tester the forward-tsn-supported parameter is NOT set.
Arrange the data at the tester that an FORWARD TSN chunk is sent to the IUT.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT upon receipt of an FORWARD TSN chunk at an association where PR-SCTP is not supported sends an ERROR-Chunk 
where any cause is considered valid. Protocol violation would be an reasonable cause.

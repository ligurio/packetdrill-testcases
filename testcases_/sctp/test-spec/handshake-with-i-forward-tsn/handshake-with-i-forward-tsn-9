Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP and the Stream Schedulers and User Message Interleaving extension.
Association is established between tester and IUT, where in the INIT-Chunk sent by the tester the forward-tsn-supported parameter is set
and the FORWARD-TSN and the I-DATA but NOT the I-FORWARD-TSN are listed at the supported extensions parameter.
Make sure that the IUT has enabled the User Message Interleaving extension.
Let the IUT send one ordered unreliable DATA-Chunk to the tester.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT has enabled PR-SCTP and has not enabled the User Message Interleaving extension for this association and
therefore uses FORWARD-TSN- and DATA-Chunks.

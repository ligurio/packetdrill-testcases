Precondition:
IUT does not support PR-SCTP and the Stream Schedulers and User Message Interleaving extension. 
Association is not established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that an INIT-Chunk with a forward-tsn-supported parameter is sent to the IUT.
Also arrange the data such that in the INIT-Chunk the FORWARD-TSN and the I-FORWARD-TSN-Chunk are listed
at the supported extensions parameter.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT responds with an INIT-ACK-Chunk where the forward-tsn-supported parameter is listed at the 
unrecognized parameters. Also ensure that the IUT does not list the FORWARD-TSN and the I-FORWARD-TSN-Chunk
at the supported extensions parameter in the INIT-ACK-Chunk.

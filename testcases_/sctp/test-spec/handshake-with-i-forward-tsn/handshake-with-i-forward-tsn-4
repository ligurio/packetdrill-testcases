Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP and the Stream Schedulers and User Message Interleaving extension.
Association is established between tester and IUT, where in the INIT-Chunk sent by the tester the forward-tsn-supported parameter is NOT set
and the FORWARD-TSN and the I-FORWARD-TSN-Chunk are NOT listed at the supported extensions parameter.
Arrange the data at the tester that an I-FORWARD-TSN chunk is sent to the IUT.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT upon receipt of an I-FORWARD-TSN chunk at an association where PR-SCTP is not supported sends an ABORT-Chunk 
where the ABORT-Chunk may include the protocol violation error cause.

Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension.
Association is established between tester and IUT, where the NR-SACK extension has been enabled.
Arrange the data at the tester such that DATA-Chunks from the IUT are ackowledged with SACK- and
NR-SACK-Chunks.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT either accepts this misbehaviour by accepting both types or sends
an ABORT-Chunk to terminate the association.

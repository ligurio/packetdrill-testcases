Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is not established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that in the INIT-Chunk the NR-SACK-Chunk is NOT listed
at the supported extensions parameter. Then complete the handshake to establish
the association.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT has disabled the NR-SACK extension for this association.

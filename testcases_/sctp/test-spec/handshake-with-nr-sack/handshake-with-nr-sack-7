Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension.
Association is established between tester and IUT, where the NR-SACK extension has been enabled.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT uses NR-SACK-Chunk for acknowledgements. Also ensure that when the tester
sends SACK-Chunks the IUT always sends NR-SACK-Chunks and never a mixture of both.

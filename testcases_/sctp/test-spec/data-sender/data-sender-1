Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends one not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the outstanding DATA-Chunk by adjusting the cum_tsn-value.
Then send another not fragmented user message from the IUT to the tester.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT transmits the second user message.
Then also acknowledge the second user message.

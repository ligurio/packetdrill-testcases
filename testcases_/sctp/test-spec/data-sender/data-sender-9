Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends one not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which has a huge cum_tsn-value (e.g. +99999 relative to the last tsn)

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT sends an ABORT-Chunk, because it has not sent any user messages with such a high tsn value.

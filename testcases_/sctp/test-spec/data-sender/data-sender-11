Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends three not fragmented user message to the tester.
Let the first and third user message be ordered and the second message be unordered.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the second user message at the nr-gap-blocks.
Expect the IUT to retransmit the first user message.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges first user message at the gap-blocks and the second user message at the nr-gap-blocks.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT retransmits the third user message now. Then acknowledge all user messages with an appropriate NR-SACK-Chunk.

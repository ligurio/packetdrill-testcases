Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends one not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the user message with the cum_tsn-value.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends one more not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester the same NR-SACK-Chunk as before.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT retransmits the second user message. Then also acknowledge the second user message.

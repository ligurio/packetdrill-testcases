Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends two not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then first send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the second user messsage in the gap-acknowledgements.
After a short time (for example 100 ms) then send another NR-SACK-Chunk at the tester that acknowledges both user messages.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT does not retransmit any DATA-Chunk. 
After a short time then also let the IUT send another third not fragmented user message.
Ensure that it does transmit this message to the tester and then also acknowledge this user message.

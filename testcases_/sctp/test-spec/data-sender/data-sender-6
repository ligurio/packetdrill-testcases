Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends three not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the first user message in the gap-acknowledgements and
the second user messsage in the nr-gap-acknowledgements.
Expect the IUT to retransmit the third user message. Then send an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the second and third
user message in the nr-gap-acknowledgements.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT retransmits the first user message this time.
Then also acknowledge the first user message.

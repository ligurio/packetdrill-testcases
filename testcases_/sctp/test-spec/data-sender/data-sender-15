Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends three not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the first and second user message in the gap-acknowledgements.
Expect the IUT to retransmit the third user message.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the first and second user message in the nr-gap-acknowledgements.
Now send at the tester again an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges only the first user message with the cum_tsn-value.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT ignores this duplicated out-of-date NR-SACK-Chunk and
retransmits the third user message again. Then also acknowledge the third user message.

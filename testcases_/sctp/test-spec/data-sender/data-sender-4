Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the IUT such that it sends two not fragmented user message to the tester.
Then send at the tester an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the second user messsage in the gap-acknowledgements.
Let the IUT retransmit the first user message and then send an NR-SACK-Chunk that only acknowledges the first user message.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT retransmits the second user message.
Then also acknowledge the second user message.

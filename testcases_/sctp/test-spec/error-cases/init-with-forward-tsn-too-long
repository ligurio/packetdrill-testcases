Precondition:
IUT does support PR-SCTP. 
Association is not established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that an INIT-Chunk with a forward-tsn-supported parameter
where the length of the forward-tsn-supported parameter is too long (e.g. 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes)
is sent to the IUT.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT either discards this invalid chunk or responds with an ABORT-chunk.

Precondition:
IUT does support PR-SCTP and the Stream Schedulers and User Message Interleaving extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that an I-FORWARD-TSN-Chunk with an
too long length in the common header is sent to the IUT.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT either discards this invalid chunk or responds with an ABORT-chunk.

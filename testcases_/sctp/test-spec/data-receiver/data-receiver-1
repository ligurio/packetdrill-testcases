Precondition:
IUT does support the NR-SACK extension. 
Association is established between tester and IUT where both sides have announced support for NR-SACK-Chunks at the handshake.
Arrange the data at the tester such that it sends one unordered not fragmented user message to the IUT.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT transmits an NR-SACK-Chunk which acknowledges the incoming user message by adjusting the cum_tsn-value.

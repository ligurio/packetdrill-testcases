Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send one ordered not fragmented unreliable user message to the tester. 
Make sure that the sent message will not be retransmitted. 
Now send an SHUTDOWN-Chunk to the IUT such that the cum_tsn does only acknowledge the still outstanding DATA-Chunk.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT abandons this user message and sends a valid FORWARD-TSN-Chunk where the cum_tsn
is equal to the second outstanding DATA-Chunk of the fragmented user message. Also ensure that the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk
is retransmitted a second time. Then send an SHUTDOWN-Chunk to the IUT where the outstanding DATA_Chunk is acknowledged.
Then also verify that the shutdown process completes successfully.

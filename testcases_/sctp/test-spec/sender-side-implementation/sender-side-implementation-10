Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP.
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send one ordered not fragmented user message to the tester. 
Then wait so long until the user message is abandoned 
and the IUT sends a FORWARD-TSN-Chunk for the outstanding user message.
Arrange the data at the tester such that the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk is not acknowledged with
a SACK-Chunk.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT retransmits the FORWARD TSN-Chunk for the abandoned user message.

Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send one ordered not fragmented unreliable user message to the tester. 
Do not send an SACK-Chunk so that the IUT abandons this user message. 
After receiving the correct FORWARD-TSN-Chunk send an SACK-Chunk such that the
abandoned user messsage is acknowledged. After that call the shutdown 
system-call with SHUT_WR.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT sends an valid SHUTDOWN-Chunk.
Also ensure that the sending of further user messages is not allowed.

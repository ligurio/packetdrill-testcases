Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send a fragmented user message as three not bundled data chunks with the stream identifier 1 and the stream sequence number 0 to the tester. Send an SACK at the tester for the first two data chunks.
Then wait so long until the T3-rtx timer of the sender expires and flags the outstanding DATA-Chunk as abandoned.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT sends a FORWARD TSN-Chunk where the new cumulative tsn is pointing to the last (third) DATA-Chunk and that the stream identifier is 1 and the stream sequence number is 0. 
Also ensure that the sender does not advance the cwnd based on the abandoned chunk.

Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP.
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send two ordered not fragmented user messages to the tester, where the first user message
has the stream identifier 1 and the second user message has the stream identifier 2. 
Then wait so long until the T3-rtx timer of the sender expires and flags both outstanding DATA-Chunks as abandoned.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT sends a valid FORWARD TSN-Chunk for the first DATA-Chunk and discards the second user message.

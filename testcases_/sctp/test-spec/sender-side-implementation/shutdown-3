Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send one ordered not fragmented unreliable user message to the tester.
After that call the shutdown system-call with SHUT_WR.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT after it has abandoned the still outstanding user message first transmits
an valid FORWARD-TSN-Chunk for this user message. Send an SACK for this FORWARD-TSN-Chunk. Then also ensure that after the receiving of the
SHUTDOWN-Chunk the shutdown process completes successfully.

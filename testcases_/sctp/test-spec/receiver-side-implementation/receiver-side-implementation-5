Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that a FORWARD-TSN where the stream identifier and stream sequence numbers are reported twice.
Let the cum_tsn of the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk be 1, the stream identifier be 1 and the stream sequence number be 0.


Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT sends a SACK-Chunk where the new cumulative tsn is the cum_tsn specified in the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk.
Also ensure that the IUT has advanced the cumulative tsn to point locally to the cum_tsn specified in the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk.

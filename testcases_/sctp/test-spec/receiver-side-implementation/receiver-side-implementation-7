Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that one ordered not fragmented user message is sent to the IUT.
Upon receipt of the SACK-Chunk for the outstanding user message let the tester send an FORWARD-TSN-Chunk to 
the IUT such that the outstanding user message should be discarded at the receiver.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT upon receipt of the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk sends a SACK-Chunk where the cum_tsn is equal to
the cum_tsn specified in the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk. Also ensure that the IUT delivers the user message to 
the userland.

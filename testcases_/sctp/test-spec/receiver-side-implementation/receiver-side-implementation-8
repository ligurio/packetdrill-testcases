Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester two ordered not fragmented user messages are sent to the IUT.
After the IUT sends an SACK for both user messages arrange the dat at the tester such that an FORWARD-TSN-Chunk
is sent to the IUT where the cum_tsn is pointing to the first user message.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT upon receipt of the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk sends a SACK-Chunk where the cum_tsn is equal to
the cum_tsn specified in the DATA-Chunk of the second user message. Then also ensure that the IUT after receipt of an
FORWARD-TSN-Chunk where the cum_tsn is pointing to the second user message sends (again) a SACK-Chunk where the cum_tsn is equal to
the cum_tsn specified in the DATA-Chunk of the second user message

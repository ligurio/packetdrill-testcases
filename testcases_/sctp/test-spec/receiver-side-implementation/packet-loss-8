Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that one last DATA-Chunk (e.g. with E-Bit set) of 
one fragmented user messages that was delivered with two DATA-Chunks is sent to the IUT.
Expect it to be SACKed by the IUT.
Then send 13 not fragmented user messages to the IUT.

Purpose:
Expect all 13 DATA-Chunks to be SACKed in gap-ackowledgments by the IUT. Then send an
FORWARD-TSN-Chunk to the IUT that skips the still oustanding fragmented user message.
Expect it to be SACKed such the cum_tsn is now equal the the last DATA-Chunk received.
Then also verify that all 13 user messages are delivered to the userland.

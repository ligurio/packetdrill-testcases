Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that a FORWARD-TSN for two ordered user message with cum_tsn=2 is sent to the IUT.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT has advanced the stream sequence numbers for both streams reported in the FORWARD-TSN correctly.
Also ensure that the IUT has advanced the cumulative tsn to point locally to the cum_tsn specified in the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk.

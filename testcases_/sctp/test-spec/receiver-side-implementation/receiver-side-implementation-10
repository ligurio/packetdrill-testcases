Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that only the last DATA-Chunk of an 
fragmented ordered user message is sent to the IUT. After receipt of 
an SACK where the last DATA-Chunk is listed at the gap acknowledgements
send at the tester a FORWARD-TSN to the IUT such that the cum_tsn is pointing to
the last DATA-Chunk of the fragmented ordered user message.
After receipt of the SACK-Chunk where the cum_tsn is equal to
the cum_tsn specified in the last DATA-Chunk of the user message transmit the
first DATA-Chunk of the fragmented user message to the IUT.


Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT upon receipt of the first DATA-Chunk of the user message sends a SACK-Chunk 
where the cum_tsn is equal to the cum_tsn specified in the FORWARD-TSN.

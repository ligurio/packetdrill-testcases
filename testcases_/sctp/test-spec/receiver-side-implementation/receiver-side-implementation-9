Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Arrange the data at the tester such that only the last DATA-Chunk of an 
fragmented ordered user message is sent to the IUT. After receipt of 
an SACK where the last DATA-Chunk is listed at the gap acknowledgements
send at the tester a FORWARD-TSN to the IUT such that the cum_tsn is pointing to
the last DATA-Chunk of the fragmented ordered user message. 


Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT upon receipt of the FORWARD-TSN-Chunk sends a SACK-Chunk where the cum_tsn is equal to
the cum_tsn specified in the last DATA-Chunk of the user message. Then also ensure that the IUT has
discarded the fragmented user message and does not deliver it to the userland.

# Handling of TCP Segments with the FIN-ACK-bits Set in the CLOSED state

## Description
This set of tests focuses on the handling of FIN-ACK-segments in the CLOSED state.
The state of the end-point should not be affected.

The required behavior is described in [RFC 0793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9).
